# AllSafe : Ceaser Cipher App
>> In order to improve the integrity, secrecy, or security of a message, the Caesar cipher is a method that modifies certain text using an encryption  algorithm. The Caesar cipher is the oldest and most widely used algorithm among encryption techniques, however there are many more algorithms in cryptography that are employed to achieve the same goal.
